Abstract
Generating data at an abundant scale has become a boon nowadays, as we see the shining side of
its features and practicality but, data quality, integrating it with other physical, cloud systems, or
storing this data could be impenetrable. Every sector including finance, retail, government, and
technology produces giant lofts of data every year. But the data produced by the healthcare
sector is very important and diverse as compared to other sectors. The records in the healthcare
industry start from electronic health records, list of medications provided to a patient, clinical
trials, insurance claims, etc. Just imagine the amount of data produced by every multinational
hospital present on this planet! It would be unimaginably huge. And this data obviously could not
be handled by traditional data processing systems, as this type of data is real-time continuous
and data storage along with analysis could be a big issue with it, hence the big data approach is
beneficial when dealing with healthcare data or any type of complex and unstructured data types

which is abundant in scale and is not easy to handle. Big data practices would lead to better data
handling, storing, and analyzing it in many cost-efficient ways.
