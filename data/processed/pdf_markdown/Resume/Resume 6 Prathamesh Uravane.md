Increasing student involvement by 34%.
● Built a student’s attentiveness Monitoring system for online classes using computer vision technology. It includes face detection, face
recognition, and facial landmark analysis. Helped to improve student assessment.
Student Researcher Intern | Energy Research Institute @ NTU | Singapore. January 2024 – March 2024
● Implemented GAN model to generate realistic road scenarios to enhance robustness of the perception system of autonomous vehicles.
AI Engineer Intern | Yodda Elder Care Technologies Pvt Limited. | Pune, India. July 2023 – December 2023
● Developed a OpenCV based fall-detection system with 95% accuracy for elderly people using pose estimation and pose-classification
classification. Integrated features like alarm triggering and snapshot delivery, enhancing the system's effectiveness during emergencies.
Student Researcher | VU Research Centre of Excellence for Health Informatics | Pune, India. June 2022 – August 2022
● Developed a CNN model for classifying brain tumors MRI images, achieving 96% accuracy with minimal computational power.
PROJECTS
1. Multi-Model Classification System for Dyslexia Detection Using Handwritten Digit Data.
● Built CNN classifiers to detect dyslexia with 90.52% accuracy using handwritten digit image data with a multi-model approach. This
approach helped to boost accuracy. Results are saved for further analysis, enabling robust and reliable detection. This approach supports
early diagnosis, for the betterment of affected people. (TensorFlow / Keras / Machine Learning / Ensemble Learning / Data Preprocessing)
2. LLM-Meeting-Minutes-Generation. (Github Link)
• Implemented an end-to-end LLM pipeline using Google Gemini for transcription and a Llama model via Hugging Face Router to
generate clean, shareable meeting minutes automatically. (Python / HuggingFace / Gradio / ML / Genai / LLM)
3. LLM-AI-Website-Summarizer. (Github Link)
• Built an AI website summarizer that extracts webpage text from a URL and generates concise summaries using an LLM, with support
for both OpenAI and local Ollama models. Packaged as an easy-to-run notebook workflow with simple setup and environment-based
key management.
PUBLICATIONS
1. IIETA: Efficient Segmentation Approach for the Traceability of Breast Cancer Tissues to Improve Diagnostic Accuracy in Ultrasound Images.
● Advanced preprocessing with multiple segmentation models analyzes breast CT images, enhancing quality and tumor delineation. Dice
and IoU evaluations show strong accuracy of 96.73%, enabling early diagnosis and informed treatment planning. (link)
2. IEEE ICCCIT’ 2025: Collating Random Forest Classifier and Artificial Neural Networks for the Risk Detection of Maternal Health. (Link)
● Compared ANN and Random Forests models for maternal health risk classification using clinical features; addressed class imbalance
via class weights/dropout; Random Forest achieved 85.71% accuracy.
3. Book chapter (IET/Elsevier, 2024): Role of the Big Data in Healthcare System. (Link)
● Healthcare generates massive, diverse, real-time data exceeding traditional systems. Big data enables scalable, cost-efficient integration,
storage, and analysis across records, medications, trials, and claims—improving handling.
