# upratham Repository Documentation

## Overview
The `upratham` repository appears to be a personal or project portfolio of Prathamesh Uravane, an applied machine learning engineer with interests spanning healthcare AI, computer vision, large language models (LLMs), MLOps, and data science. The repository likely contains code, projects, and resources related to these domains, serving as a showcase of skills, research, and applied projects.

*Note:* The provided data does not specify a detailed project or codebase structure. The overview is inferred from the README content and repository metadata.

## Key Features
- **Showcase of Applied ML Projects:** Includes projects on debate simulation, brochure generation, webpage summarization, ML pipelines, and sleep disorder prediction.
- **Research Publications:** Links to multiple research papers in medical imaging, healthcare, and AI.
- **Tech Stack & Tools:** Demonstrates proficiency in Python, C++, web technologies, and AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- **Community & Collaboration:** Open to research collaborations, open-source contributions, and project sharing.
- **Personal Branding:** Well-structured README with contact info, achievements, publications, and social links.

## Architecture / How it Works
While specific implementation details are not provided, the structure suggests:
- The repository hosts multiple projects, each likely in separate folders or notebooks.
- Projects utilize Python for ML, web scraping, and API interactions.
- Some projects involve web scraping (`BeautifulSoup`), API calls (`OpenAI SDK`), and ML pipelines (`DVC`, `AWS S3`).
- The presence of configuration files like `.gitattributes` indicates version control and project management practices.

*Note:* Exact architecture diagrams or detailed workflows are not available.

## Notable Folders/Files
- **README.md:** The main documentation and personal/professional profile.
- **.gitattributes:** Git configuration for handling line endings, file types, or language-specific settings.
- *Note:* No other folders or files are listed, so project-specific codebases or datasets are not explicitly shown.

## Setup & Run
Based on the projects and tools mentioned:
- To run individual projects, you would typically clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/upratham/upratham.git
  cd upratham
  ```
- Install dependencies (assuming standard Python environment):
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  *Note:* The presence of a `requirements.txt` is inferred but not confirmed.
- For projects involving ML pipelines or web scraping, follow project-specific instructions, likely found in respective notebooks or README files within project folders.

## How to Use
- Explore the linked projects in the README for practical examples:
  - Use the **LLM Debate Simulator** by running the Python scripts or notebooks provided.
  - Generate brochures or summarize websites by executing the respective scripts with sample inputs.
  - Deploy or test ML pipelines using DVC and AWS S3 configurations.
- Contact the author via email or LinkedIn for collaboration or access to specific project code.

*Note:* Specific usage instructions are not provided in the excerpt, so users should look for project-specific README files or scripts.

## Testing / CI
No explicit information about testing frameworks or continuous integration setups is available. The presence of DVC and notebooks suggests some level of reproducibility and version control, but CI/CD pipelines are not mentioned.

## Deployment
No details on deployment procedures are provided. Projects involving web apps or APIs likely require standard deployment steps (e.g., Flask/FastAPI deployment), but these are not explicitly documented.

## Contribution Notes
There are no explicit contribution guidelines or notes included in the provided data.

## Limitations / TODOs (Inferred)
- **Lack of detailed documentation:** Specific instructions for setup, usage, and contribution are not present.
- **No explicit project structure:** The organization of code, datasets, or models is unclear.
- **Deployment and CI/CD details are missing:** No information on how projects are deployed or tested automatically.
- **Further clarification needed:** To provide comprehensive guidance, access to project folders, scripts, or additional documentation is necessary.
