RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Systems

Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of large language models with external knowledge retrieval. This approach enhances the capabilities of AI systems by allowing them to access and utilize specific information from a knowledge base.

How RAG Works:
1. Document Ingestion: Documents are processed and split into manageable chunks
2. Embedding Generation: Each chunk is converted into a vector representation
3. Vector Storage: Embeddings are stored in a vector database for efficient retrieval
4. Query Processing: User queries are converted to embeddings
5. Retrieval: Most relevant document chunks are retrieved based on similarity
6. Generation: LLM generates responses using the retrieved context

Benefits of RAG:
- Up-to-date Information: Access to current knowledge without retraining models
- Reduced Hallucinations: Grounded responses based on actual documents
- Cost-Effective: No need to fine-tune large models
- Transparency: Source documents can be cited and verified
- Scalability: Easy to add or update knowledge base

Applications:
- Enterprise Knowledge Management
- Customer Support Systems
- Research Assistants
- Documentation Search
- Legal Document Analysis
