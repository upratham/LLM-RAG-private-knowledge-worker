Vector Databases and Embeddings

Vector databases are specialized systems designed to store and retrieve high-dimensional vectors efficiently. They are essential components of RAG systems.

What are Embeddings?
Embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning. Similar concepts have similar vector representations, enabling semantic search.

Popular Embedding Models:
1. Sentence Transformers: Efficient models for generating sentence embeddings
2. OpenAI Embeddings: High-quality embeddings from OpenAI API
3. BERT-based Models: Contextual embeddings from transformer models
4. Custom Models: Fine-tuned for specific domains

Vector Search Methods:
- Cosine Similarity: Measures angle between vectors
- Euclidean Distance: Measures straight-line distance
- Dot Product: Measures vector alignment
- FAISS: Facebook's library for efficient similarity search

Choosing Vector Dimensions:
- Smaller dimensions (128-384): Faster, lower memory
- Larger dimensions (768-1536): Better accuracy, more resources
- Trade-off between performance and quality

Best Practices:
- Use consistent embedding models for indexing and querying
- Normalize vectors when using cosine similarity
- Consider approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) for large datasets
- Regularly update embeddings when documents change
